# Low Voltage Career

Started working with Eunitel November 2022, under a journeyman with 20 years experience. I got a lot of hands on experience within my first 3 months of working with the journeyman. After that point, i was sent to my own jobs, operating scissor lifts, extension ladders and what not. I do have 6 years construction experience aswell which helps a lot. In these 11 months of being a subcontractor for Unitel, we focused primarily on data, working in Ecolabs, NSA's office building in downtown Chicago's government building, and data centers. I have a background in I.T aswell, having knowledge of computers and hardware, including configuring software and programs. Currently in school for cyber security, i have multiple labs within my portfolio tab aswell, but here are some pictures of work I did during my time in Eunitel.

## Occupancy Lighting Job

-  After installing our power packs and relays with the occupancy light fixture switches, 2 14 guage wire was ran through the conduit to connect the light fixture temperature, so that each department in the building can manually set each individual light fixture to have a warmer tone or a colder tone.

- Here are the insides of a 1900 box where we spliced into the 110 wire to power our powerpacks/relays for each light fixture, then connected each occupancy sensor to the power back via CAT-5e cables, with RJ-45 connectors. The reason we connected the RJ-45 to the relay was to properly supply the correct voltage to not fry the occupancy switch.

- This was the north part of the building with every drop and location for each power pack, and relay.

- Everything installed before final dress up, we were working in an open concept building and followed the design of the engineer and interior designers, yet to still maintain the most efficent motion detection for every switch.
